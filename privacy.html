            <p>FaceRater Bro ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").</p>
            <p>Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2 class="section-title">1. Information We Collect</h2>

            <h3 class="subheading">1.1 Face Data Collection and Use</h3>
            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>EXPLICIT STATEMENT: Face Data Is NOT Retained Indefinitely</strong></p>
                <p style="color: #0ea5e9; font-weight: 600; font-size: 16px; margin-bottom: 20px;">Face data (photos and facial analysis results) is NOT retained indefinitely. All face data is automatically deleted after a maximum of 365 days from upload. You can delete your face data at any time before this period expires.</p>

                <p><strong>What Face Data We Collect:</strong></p>
                <p>When you use our facial analysis feature, we collect photographs that you voluntarily upload (front-facing and optional side-facing photos). These photos contain facial geometry and characteristics that our AI analyzes.</p>

                <p><strong>Reasons for Storing Face Data:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Perform AI-powered facial feature analysis (eyes, nose, jawline, symmetry, bone structure, lips, skin, hair, and overall appearance assessment)</li>
                    <li>Generate appearance scores for entertainment purposes</li>
                    <li>Maintain your scan history for progress tracking</li>
                    <li>Enable you to compare results over time</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Length of Time Face Data Is Stored and Why:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Maximum Retention Period:</strong> 365 days (1 year) from the date of upload</li>
                    <li><strong>Reason for 365-Day Duration:</strong> This duration allows you to maintain your scan history, track progress over time, and access comparative analysis features. We believe 365 days balances user utility (annual progress tracking) with privacy protection. Face data is automatically deleted after this period to ensure it is not stored indefinitely.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Deletion:</strong> All face data is automatically and permanently deleted after 365 days, even if you take no action</li>
                    <li><strong>User Control:</strong> You can delete your face data at any time before the 365-day period expires</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Third Parties We Share Face Data With:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                        <strong>1. Google Gemini (Vision API)</strong><br>
                        <strong>Purpose:</strong> AI-powered facial analysis and score generation<br>
                        <strong>Does Google Gemini Store Face Data?</strong> <span style="color: #0ea5e9; font-weight: 600;">NO</span> - Google Gemini does NOT retain, store, or use your face data after processing is complete. Images are processed in real-time and immediately discarded. Google does not use images submitted via the API for model training or any other purpose.<br>
                        <strong>Google's Privacy Practices:</strong> Zero retention policy for API data. See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/discover/data-governance" style="color: #0ea5e9;">Google Gemini Data Governance</a> for more information.

                        <strong>2. Google Firebase Cloud Storage (Google Cloud Platform)</strong><br>
                        <strong>Purpose:</strong> Secure cloud storage for maintaining your scan history and enabling cross-device access<br>
                        <strong>Does Firebase/Google Store Face Data?</strong> <span style="color: #0ea5e9; font-weight: 600;">YES</span> - Firebase stores your face data (photos and analysis results) encrypted on Google Cloud Platform servers for the duration specified in our retention policy (maximum 365 days or until you delete it, whichever comes first).<br>
                        <strong>Firebase/Google's Privacy Practices:</strong><br>
                        • All face data is encrypted at rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS/SSL)<br>
                        • Google Cloud Platform maintains SOC 2, ISO 27001, and other security certifications<br>
                        • Compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other global privacy regulations<br>
                        • Restricted access controls - only authorized systems can access encrypted data<br>
                        • Regular third-party security audits and penetration testing<br>
                        • Physical security measures at data center locations<br>
                        • Google automatically deletes data when you delete it from our app or after the 365-day retention period<br>
                        • Firebase does not use your face data for any other purpose beyond storage<br>
                        • See <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" style="color: #0ea5e9;">Firebase Privacy and Security</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/privacy" style="color: #0ea5e9;">Google Cloud Privacy</a> for more information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>No Other Third Parties:</strong> We do NOT sell, rent, or share your facial images with any other third parties for marketing, advertising, research, or any other purposes.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Data Storage Location:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Images are stored in Firebase Cloud Storage (Google Cloud Platform infrastructure)</li>
                    <li>Analysis results are stored in Firebase Firestore database</li>
                    <li>Device-level caching may occur in your local app storage</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Face Data Deletion and Retention Policy:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Automatic Deletion After 365 Days:</strong> Face data (photos and facial analysis results) is automatically and permanently deleted after 365 days from the date of upload, even if you do not manually delete it. This ensures face data is NEVER stored indefinitely.</li>
                    <li><strong>User-Initiated Deletion (Anytime):</strong> You can delete individual scans at any time before the 365-day period expires. When you delete a scan, both the photos and analysis results are permanently deleted from Firebase Storage and Firestore within 24 hours.</li>
                    <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you delete your entire account, ALL photos and face data are permanently deleted within 30 days maximum, regardless of the 365-day retention period.</li>
                    <li><strong>Processing-Only (Google Gemini):</strong> Images sent to Google Gemini API are NEVER retained or stored by Google after processing is complete. Google Gemini does not store face data at all - zero retention period.</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Your Control Over Face Data:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can delete individual scans at any time from your scan history</li>
                    <li>You can delete your entire account and all associated data from Settings</li>
                    <li>You control what photos you upload - the app never accesses your camera or photos without explicit permission</li>
